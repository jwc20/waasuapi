We're not just making collaboration faster—we're crafting it to be the best.Today we’re all using online platforms more than ever before - building, researching, learning, connecting etc. And we're not doing it alone. We're doing it together with other people and machines, turning the internet into the world's biggest team.Yet, the web was built for solo voyages. We saw a shift when platforms like Figma and Google Docs brought a multiplayer approach, breaking down walls and inspiring seamless teamwork.At Velt, we're taking it further. We're on a mission to infuse the magic of collaboration into the fabric of the web—one app at a time. We aim to erase the lines between online and offline co-working, crafting an environment where distance is irrelevant, and 'flow' is the norm.Right now, more than half of work hours are spent on coordination and communication—less on creating. With Velt, we're setting out to reverse these figures, reducing time spent on logistical issues by over 90%. Imagine what we can create when we spend less time talking about work and more time doing it!We're building a better web—a web for us, for our team, for everyone. Join us, and let's accelerate the future of web together 🚀Our Products:Velt SDK: JS SDK to add powerful collaboration experiences to your own product for your end-users. This helps you ship such experiences ridiculously fast, increase user growth and engagement.Superflow: JS plugin to enable product, marketing and design teams to comment and collaborate directly on their websites. This helps them iterate and ship their products 10x faster.TeamWe are a team of ex-Googlers. We've launched products like Augmented Reality in Google Search & Maps. As an early team member, you will work directly with the founders.Come build a better web with us 🚀",

Roboflow streamlines the process of labeling, training, and deploying a computer vision model.WhyComputer vision is going to transform every industry. We're already seeing this play out in fields like transportation (self driving cars), agriculture (drone spraying), and medicine (early stage cancer detection). But these superpowers shouldn't be locked up in the handful of giant technology companies that can afford to hire teams of machine learning PhDs.WhatRoboflow enables any developer to use computer vision without being a machine learning expert. Our product is the key missing infrastructure that allows developers turn raw images into a useful model -- replacing a sprawling list of one-off utils everyone previously had to reinvent and enabling our users to have working models in hours, not weeks.For example, Sarah Hinkley from Barn Owl Drones uses vision to identify weeds from crops in drone images so her customers can use fewer herbicides and grow more. She's one of our over 50,000 users working on problems we couldn't even imagine when we got started!WhoRoboflow is a venture-backed SaaS startup that empowers innovators all over the world to build, train, and deploy computer vision models. Roboflow believes that computer vision is a foundation technology that will transform nearly every industry. We currently have over 250,000 users, including half of the Fortune 100. Roboflow has enabled our customers to accelerate cancer research, conduct experiments in space, accelerate the world’s transition to green energy, and improve the retail experience (to name a few!) with world-altering technology. Investors like Y Combinator, David Sack’s Craft Ventures, Lachy Groom, the founders of OpenAI (Sam Altman and Greg Brockman), and many others back Roboflow.As with any rapidly scaling startup, we hope to build a team that is both versatile and adaptable. Each role has tremendous potential for growth. As such, we believe that coachability, enthusiasm, and an entrepreneurial mindset are more important than experience or qualifications.GrowthRoboflow went from zero to over 20,000 users in 2020 (and now to over 50,000 in 2021) and our customers are requesting features and product enhancements faster than we can provide them.We're starting to build out our engineering, marketing, and sales teams. As an integral part of our core team, all roles will inevitably involve wearing a lot of hats; we're specifically looking for people excited about learning new things and filling gaps where needed. And most importantly, we're looking for people who ship.Learn more about us on our careers page (https://roboflow.com/careers).",
        "tech": "Our goal is to build the world's best computer vision infrastructure so our users don't have to. This means we handle a lot of challenging complexities like seamlessly ingesting dozens of data formats, processing millions of images per day, and deploying auto-scaling machine learning infrastructure that can handle our customers' most demanding training and deployment needs.Our core app sits atop Firebase with assistance from auto-scaling groups of Docker containers (for jobs like archiving datasets and training models). We also heavily lean on serverless infrastructure so we can gracefully deal with bursty traffic involved in manipulating datasets that can range anywhere from one hundred to one million images.We also maintain a library of Colab notebooks our customers can use to train common computer vision models, a directory of public datasets, and a web of format specifications. We see building and supporting mini-projects like these that are helpful to the community at large as part of our role in democratizing computer vision.",

Our core strength lies in our exceptional tech talent and our commitment to leveraging the power of AI, which is already transforming how we operate and interact with our communities.",
        "tech": "Here are the core traits that define how the tech team works at Aldara.Lean engineering. Own the problem end-to-endWe don’t have Product Managers, Agile Coaches or Scrum Masters. We trust our engineers to be able to understand the problems at hand, devise the best solution, share it with others and own the implementation from start to finish. The engineers who excel at Aldara are those that take pleasure in mastering all parts of the stack, from database modeling to UX design, to bring together a fully functional feature. The only big meetings we really have are the biweekly Demos, where engineers come together to share & showcase the latest changes to the rest of the company.Horizontal structure with few but high quality contributorsYou’ll be reporting directly to the CTO, while interacting heavily with Operations and Account Management to get the feedback cycle working. We don’t have teams in engineering, and we want to keep it that way as long as we can by hiring few but very high quality individual contributors. As an engineer, you’ll be deeply integrated with the rest of the team, working often with the internal stakeholders as well as the end customer. You will also be working closely with our providers, from local ones to big corps, as we develop our relationships with them as an additional player in our ecosystem. We believe a horizontal structure with a high motivation for debate brings forward the best product choices.Focus on building great, scalable software, with rock-solid architecture to deploy itOur stack is simple: Postgres, Django, React, Terraform, and AWS are the main pieces, with Datadog to keep track of it all. We care a lot about our developer UX and setup to make developers have the easiest time adding a new feature, testing it thoroughly and deploying it in the same beat. We’ve got 95% testing coverage checked on every PR, one-click deployments happening constantly and a carefully thought out code structure that focuses on modular software that can be easily reused. Our local setup replicates the production environment to a tee. Develop locally and instantly debug your traces using Datadog, comparing against production traces.Freedom to explore and have fun, creativity is our best tool to engineer the future we wantWe don’t shy away from investing time in trying out new approaches to problems we need to solve. There’s offsite weeks when we go hack on something for a few days in an amazing venue with full focus. Regular hackathons where the whole team reconfigures into small pods that build something fun for a day or two. We want to foster your curiosity, allow you to explore and find new and better ways to solve problems. We believe the future of our space includes way more automation, AI, and inference than it does now, and we’ll only get there by allowing you to be as creative as possible.",

Behind the scenes, it executes queries against billions of data points across different types of databases and combines the results together in seconds.Using Kubernetes and Docker, we re-built the infrastructure and tooling that powers our background task processing system, which runs billions of jobs every day. We’re able to dynamically scale up and down our total processing capacity automatically based on workload - which means things execute faster for our clients, we save loads of money on idle servers, and our engineers can sleep at night.We designed and built a Javascript SDK that other developers (our clients and partners) integrate directly on their websites and online stores to pump customer preferences and behaviour into Hive. Because of this (and our other integrations), our product often is the only place where our clients can view and store all of their customers’ preferences, behaviours, and purchase history in one single “database”.",

But, like most insurance products, they're really complicated to set up and use so they're not popular. We think we can change that. We want to make HRAs so easy and delightful to use that they become a default component of every benefits package.

We’re now building on the success of Read with Ello and putting together the pieces of the world’s first complete AI teacher for children. We’re a highly technical team building delightful learner-centered experiences which leverage the massive recent advances in AI. Our products put children on a path of lifelong learning, creating the foundation for their future and ours. Together, we believe we can close literacy and educational gaps around the world. We are backed by world-class investors, just closed a Series A, and we’re ready to bring on new talent to help achieve our vision. Our team has deep expertise in artificial intelligence, K-12 education, and child development across institutions such as Stanford, Berkeley, Google, Apple, and more. We were part of Y Combinator’s W20 batch and have recently closed a funding round; previously announced investors include leading US and European VCs including Project A Ventures, Reach Capital, Khosla Ventures, Homebrew, WndrCo, Human Capital and K9 Ventures. We’re a small, collaborative team that takes each other’s voices very seriously. Because our mission is to support all children, it is critical that our team is representative of the wider community; we place significant emphasis on ensuring diversity in our team and inclusion in our culture. We want to create an environment in which we can all be our best selves, use our strengths to take Ello forward, and develop our own skills.

In fact, over 90% of all healthcare data is medical imagery! However, the global radiology workforce is overburdened. In the UK, for example, only 2% of radiology departments are able to fulfill their reporting requirements, and this trend is reflected worldwide.The acute state of radiology, coupled with the abundance of data, makes the use of AI in radiology a prime candidate. In 2022, $5.6 billion was invested in the development of AI in healthcare!

Most have jobs, families, and privacy concerns, making it easier to get withdrawal medication from a drug dealer than go to rehab. Meanwhile, 2/3rds of rehabs do not offer medication at all, leading 90% of patients to relapse in the first 3 months. As a result of inadequate access to proven treatment, an American dies of an opioid overdose every 11 minutes.We are a team of world-renowned doctors, scientists, startup veterans, and White House advisors, backed by leading technology and healthcare investors (Y Combinator, General Catalyst) to re-imagine and re-build addiction treatment in America.Join us, save lives, and help fix healthcare for those who need it most.",

This cash grab not only hurts providers, who are overworked and underpaid, it also hurts quality of care.

Then, with handheld cameras and smartphones, millions of people gained the ability to create great videos. Sites like Youtube, Tiktok, and Instagram are flooded with wonderful user-created videos today. Generative AI is continuing this 100+ year trend of democratizing video creation to all. Instead of needing to go out and film, users can create videos from just text prompts! However, it's not easy to use this technology... There are complicated hardware requirements, constant research improvements, and too much randomness with the outputs. Decohere is building a purpose-built tool for video creation to solve all these problems. Our tool gives users an intuitive interface and unique controls over the video generation process. It eliminates all requirements and lets our users simply get to work creating their ideal video.Most importantly, video is about to undertake an inflection point. Video generation is starting to reach out of the \"Uncanny Valley\" and provide real value to the billions of creators and consumers of videos worldwide. Moments like this do not come often, and we at Decohere want to ensure that we can guide these incredible technologies to users in the most powerful and helpful way.",

It allows developers to integrate live video into their apps in interesting and innovative ways. The SDK is simple, offers integrations within hours, and has a large number of plug-ins and configurations. These configurations provide developers with a quick and efficient way to embed audio and video calling in any way imaginable to suit a use-case. That means, 1-1 calls, recording, webinars, livestreams can all be personalised and delivered with a variety of options to enhance user and developer experience! The goal is to reimagine what can be achieved with these APIs and continue to push the envelope, going above and beyond. We're looking for inventive minds to join us on this journey to build the new.",
        "tech": "At Dyte, what we are trying to achieve, is only possible with a combination of reliable, well tested technologies, along with cutting edge developments and a lot of in-house experimentation. A glimpse of the technologies we use and what excites us about our roadmap:Full-stack webRTC, with compatibility for all: We tailor the experience to make use of the best webRTC capabilities each client has to offer, falling back to lowest common denominator only where extremely necessary.Custom A/V pipelines: We encode and inject streams with custom audio/video processing logic and media enhancing AI to bring out the quality beyond what webRTC is capable of.Scalable micro-services: Our infrastructure handles a million video minutes every day but that isn't good enough for our own internal standards, we are looking to improve and scale it even further.Homegrown testing framework: Because what we are building is not standard. We recognised the need early on to build our own tools for testing what we build and its resiliency at the scale we look to offer.Abstract all complexity, offer intuitive and beautiful APIs to customers: We offer flexibility of getting started in a few minutes, or to dive deep into the streams and components level, along with a host of features built on top of the communication and media aspects of our product.",

We realize this is an ambitious plan, but we think it's high time someone built this. There is no good reason for the insane fragmentation in programming tools today -- someone learning to code needs to learn at least ten disjointed tools and platforms to do anything interesting with programming.",
        "tech": "Most of our time is spent building two core areas of our technology -- the IDE and the container infrastructure. We created the world's fastest and first server-rendered IDE. The IDE has a small functional core -- borrowing ideas from Redux -- everything is a plugin. This architecture allows us to build an adaptable IDE where it starts very simple and grows with the user as they learn more and require more features -- this is crucial for new programmers.As for our infrastructure, we're building a new kind of computing platform: it's Serverless in that users don't have to care about the underlying resources, but it's not Serverless in that it's stateful. This way it's interactive, and since we're focused on newcomers, it's a much more natural programming model. We're also building a filesystem abstraction that allows your working directory to travel with your container between development and production and as it goes offline and online -- a persistent and versioned working directory.",

We’re helping millions navigate Medicaid end-to-end from eligibility and enrollment to renewing coverage. We're backed by a16z, BoxGroup, YC, and top healthcare angels.Our product is TurboTax for Medicaid. Today, ~90M Medicaid consumers navigate glitchy websites and long paper forms. The experience is so poor that procedural reasons (e.g., form errors, missing a notice in the mail) account for a staggering 75% of dis-enrollments. We believe this can only be solved with a modern and simple UX that is fundamentally consumer-centric.Creating ValueThe problem at the consumer level produces huge downstream consequences: There's over $50B of administrative waste and lost revenue suffered by Medicaid health plans, providers, and states. By making products that consumers want to use, we unlock immense value for these players. Our vision is to become the consumer-facing digital infrastructure that powers the $800B+ Medicaid ecosystem.Who we areWe each have multiple years of experience in healthtech — Nikita started her career at Oscar and built pharmacy solutions at Truepill (YC S17), Cydney helped scale Halo Dx from seed to series C on the ops side, and Ben was the first engineer at Juniper (YC W21) where he helped scale the engineering team to 12. We have all had direct experience with Medicaid throughout our careers and have seen firsthand the challenges that affect the population.We started Fortuna because we care about impact — the abysmal state of the Medicaid consumer journey means that the most underserved people in America can't access the benefits that they need and are entitled to. We believe this is a once in a lifetime opportunity to dramatically improve the human condition for 90M people, and we need the help of high-throughput, growth-minded builders to make it happen.",
        "tech": "Our fundamental thesis revolves around a consumer-centric experience. We are taking complex government forms and turning them into a modern, streamlined UX. Hence, our product is heavy on frontend. Think form logic, components, design, UI/UX, and user behavior research/analysis.On the backend there's the infrastructure you'd expect to see to support this kind of frontend, focusing on integrations with different vendors and user data sources. We are also building systems to support the operational side of the business, including integrations with government portals and county offices (i.e. scripting/scraping, RPA, and mail or fax).Our tech stack is currently FastAPI (Python) on the backend and Next.js/React on the frontend.That said, we are in the early stages of the company, so nothing is set in stone.

While data quality (just like software quality) is a complex and multifaceted problem, we draw from decades of our team’s combined experience in the data domain to build opinionated tools our users love. Specifically, we believe that:Data quality is a byproduct of a great data engineering workflow. That means, rather than building yet-another-app for data practitioners to switch to and from, we insert our tools in the existing workflows, for example, in CI/CD for deployment testing and IDEs for testing during development.Data quality issues should be addressed before deploying the code. Most data quality issues are bugs in the code that processes data, and applying a proactive, shift-left approach is the most effective way to achieve high shopping velocity and data quality simultaneously. Read moreLack of metadata (data about data) is the biggest gap in the data engineering workflow. We bring powerful tools such as data diffing and column-level lineage to every data engineer’s workflow to help them validate the code and underlying data and fully understand the dependencies in complex data pipelines.Datafold is used by data teams at Patreon, Thumbtack, Substack, Angellist, among others, and raised $22M from YC, NEA & Amplify Partners.",
        "tech": "Datafold is a distributed web application with a rich interactive UI. Our backend is primarily written in Python with the use of FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, and Celery. We rely on Rust for specialized and performance-critical components. The data is stored in PostgreSQL, Neo4j (metadata graph), and Clickhouse (logs and time series). Our frontend is written in Typescript with the use of React, Redux, and GraphQL. We also use WebAssembly for performance-critical components.",

Research is typically published as a PDF, with scraps of code on GitHub and weights on Google Drive (if you’re lucky!). It is near-impossible to take that work and apply it to a real-world problem, unless you are an expert.We’re making machine learning accessible to everyone. People creating machine learning models should be able to share them in a way that other people can use, and people who want to use machine learning should be able to do it without getting a PhD.With great power also comes great responsibility. We believe that with better tools and safeguards, we will make this powerful technology safer and easier to understand.How we workWe're a kind, creative, hard-working bunch. We care about our work and our users. We're humble and show humility. We're looking for the same in the people we work with.When starting this company, we thought: instead of getting a job at the best place to work, let's make that best place to work.

Secoda's platform is built on top of a PostgresSQL database that makes organizing data resources and finding the between them simple and flexible. We have designed our own SQL parser to automatically find the lineage of data resources in a company's data ecosystem. We have created a SQL editor to run queries against popular data warehouses and built charting capabilities to showcase query results. We've implemented a task engine to schedule and run concurrent extractions from data sources. All of the components in Secoda are organized into a micro-service architecture leveraging Docker containers in AWS.We've just scratched the tip of the iceberg when it comes to problems that we're solving, so if the idea of working to make data be more accessible and and easy to use excites you, come work at Secoda!",

Our mission is to build the most efficient revenue management engine for B2B companies. Today, most companies get by using spreadsheets and manual processes across multiple single-point solutions, which is inefficient and costs millions in lost revenue.We solve this by unifying the quote-to-revenue process and automating complex back-office operations. This enables our customers (growth-stage startups and enterprises) to flexibly close more deals faster without worrying about internal limitations and relying on finance and engineering teams.We're multi-cultural and welcome diversity. We have team members across three continents and five nations. Company ValuesAct efficiently: We strive to work smarter, not harder, we establish feedback loops as soon as possible and focus on what differentiates us.Be intentional: We’re deliberate in our actions, setting clear goals and priorities.Care deeply: We empathize with our customers and our colleagues. We trust by default and give timely, constructive feedback.Drive excellence: We have high standards and hold ourselves accountable for them. Ideas are pursued on merit, informed by actual testing and data.",

For every hour we spend on complex solutions, that’s an hour we’ve lost of iteration.Be efficient: If there’s a reasonably priced SaaS that delivers something we need for not much money, let’s not waste development hours re-implementing solved problems.Be opinionated: We don’t want to have several ways of solving non-novel problems, let’s use opinionated frameworks and technologies that allow us to move quickly.Expect to iterate: The architecture will need to evolve over time, so don’t make choices that build us into a corner.Account for cost. We should assess for cost from day one rather than address it in 1-2 years.StackFrontend: Our customer dashboard and website are built with NextJS, using Tailwind and React, and deployed on Vercel.

Deasie is a platform built for the world's leading enterprises. Deasie was part of the summer 2023 batch of Y Combinator and closed a $3M seed round in Sep 2023, with investors including General Catalyst & RTP Global.Deasie's founding team are from McKinsey, QuantumBlack & Amazon, and previously led the build of McKinsey's flagship ML data quality product. The team has educational backgrounds from MIT, the University of Cambridge & the National University of Singapore.",
        "tech": "Today, most enterprises fail to take their LLM use cases past the 'proof of concept phase'. One of the main challenges is that LLMs simply lack the contextual knowledge required to reliably sift through thousands of documents and consistently retrieve the correct piece of data. The core technological functionality of Deasie is the auto-creation of metadata relating to both the content and safety of all documents, for which a combination of LLMs and traditional ML models are used. Our metadata tagging ranges from: What document version is this ... to... is this data covered under an NDA ... to ... take all of the types of coverage included in this insurance document... Through creating this metadata and feeding it into the LLM via the Deasie Index, the LLM accuracy can be enhanced significantly.",

They're becoming the standard place to centralize customer data at a company, given how cheap and accessible warehouses have become. HIghtouch exists to help companies get their data out of the warehouse (reverse ETL) and into the hands of sales, marketing, and product teams.Business users can't get data into their SaaS tools without help from engineering. Hightouch is the easiest way to get customer data from your database or data warehouse into your SaaS tools. Just write SQL in our UI, map the columns to the fields in your SaaS tool, and then watch the data live sync into your SaaS tool. Some common examples include getting data into sales (Salesforce, Hubspot), marketing (Iterable, Braze,  MailChimp), and support (Zendesk, Intercom) tools.Why is this a big deal? SaaS tooling like Salesforce have been promising to be the customer source of truth for years, but have never achieved that goal. Warehouses have accomplished that vision, but lack the final piece which is getting the data back into the operational systems where it can be used. Hightouch closes this loop and captures the value of getting data into these systems.We're growing rapidly, have a user base that raves about us, and recently raised a Series A from top firms!",

On the infrastructure side, Hightouch leverages common AWS services such as EC2, ECS, RDS, S3, and DynamoDB.Hightouch is \"warehouse-native\" meaning that we connect to our customers' data warehouses and use it as our primary data source. Much of our own functionality is driven through these external warehouses, so we consider these to also be a critical part of our stack.",

        "tech": "With the plethora of data available in databases today, applying predictive modeling can often feel overwhelming - especially if you need to write complex applications for ingesting data, training encoders and embedders, writing sampling models, training, optimizing, scheduling, versioning,  moving models into production environments, maintaining them and then having to explain the predictions and the degree of confidence… we thought there had to be a better way!  We aim to steer you away from constantly reinventing the wheel by abstracting most of the unnecessary complexities around building, training, and deploying machine learning models.  MindsDB provides you with two techniques for this: Build and train models as simply as writing a SQL query, and seamlessly “publish” and manage machine learning models as virtual  tables inside your databases.

Qventus helps hospitals like Stanford/Mayo Clinic/Emory/New York Presbyterian reduce wait time for patients, prevent patient falls, and generally helps hospitals deliver a better and safer experience for patients, resulting in reduced injuries, loss of life, and financial waste.We're making a big difference.  Qventus has meaningfully affected patient experiences and outcomes for almost 4 million patients across the united states. Our platform works with hospital data to predict negative outcomes for patients and associated potentially disastrous situations that are likely to occur, then applies our system of action to reach the right doctors and nurses, at the right time, telling them where to go to stop these events before they happen. Think Minority Report applied to hospitals.Our founding team has done this before.  Two of our three founders worked in consulting for over a decade solving efficiency problems in hospitals. They know hospitals, where they've been, where they want to go, and how to work within them to drive the necessary mind shift and change management we need to drive this new wave of technology.Our team is top notch!  We have the fortune of having amazing engineerings and data scientists from top schools (Stanford, MIT, Cal, etc.) applying the latest in artificial intelligence and machine learning to create products that help healthcare organizations around the world and their people adapt in the moment and make the right decisions from the most complex data. Furthermore, we employ several practicing clinicians (practicing surgeons, doctors, nurses) in the company to help us understand the hospital environment. We take what we do very seriously.",

Functional QA is largely outsourced, we prefer to have QA team focused more on the engineering required to scale a large QA org.Some of the challenges we are facing:1) Using AI/ML- We use predictive analysis to help doctors and nurses make proactive operational decisions so they can focus on patient care2) Data scaling- We are starting to get significantly larger volumes of data, which is also increasingly becoming more and more clinical (lab results, etc) in nature.3)Data sensitivity- Because this data is more clinical, it is more sensitive and requires a higher bar on how we set up and monitor our systems.4)Data Ingestion- Getting data out of hospitals is not an easy task. We have to figure out more scalable solutions to help us grow quickly. This is an industry wide problem and we are looking to do it better than just about anyone else.5)Product growth- Expansion in more areas of the hospital means we have more to learn and an opportunity to expand our product to achieve more outcomes.",

        "tech": "The product can be thought of as a declarative machine-learning tool for creating ranking and recommendation models within a few hours. All you need to do to get started with Shaped is map your user and item data schema through our model creation endpoint. Shaped then handles all the difficult parts of recommendations, i.e the data ingestion, model training and real-time deployment. This makes it really easy for customers to get personalized recommendations and see value from day one. Behind the scenes Shaped uses state-of-the-art neural networks to learn the most from our customers data. We pride our selves in understanding any data that's fed through the API, whether it be unstructured data, like image or text, or structured tabular data. The key to making Shaped, really easy to use, has been all our data connectors, both at the data warehouse level (e.g. BigQuery, Redshift) and real-time application connectors (e.g. Segment, Amplitude).Our infrastructure uses AWS severless technologies mostly written in python.",

But at the same time data continuity through cloud is important since they want to move data in between mobile devices.Our tech includes native Kotlin based Android app using MVVM architecture. We use OpenCV and on device ML models for Computer Vision.On cloud which has 1 mn+ users we use a bunch of Microservices written in Java, Spring Boot and SQL databases on the surface. Alongwith a bunch of NoSQL thrown in. We are also going to be using Messaging Queue systems in the near future for load of batch jobs.",

We intend to be the platform layer that brings this amazing technology to life in production use cases. We enable companies to bring real business value from AI / LLMs. The output generated by AI / LLMs is usually stochastic and bringing AI into production requires robust testing and choosing the right model for the job. We’ve seen companies spend months of engineering time building good tooling for this (time which could be spent on their core end user facing product) yet despite this, they struggle to get the best results out of these models. Our platform provides companies best in class tooling to use their own data in production AI applications.We’re a YC W23 company, raised $5m, and are backed by top investors like Rebel Fund, Eastlink Capital, Arash Ferdowsi (co-founder of Dropbox), Dharmesh Shah (co-founder of Hubspot), Dan Scholnick (board member of Weights & Biases, Docker, New Relic), and Divya Bhat (former YC group partner, 2x CEO).

So Retool gives you those building blocks, which you can combine and compose to make any sort of internal tool you might want. That's a lot faster than writing the same custom code, over and over again. Here's a 3 minute demo.Our actual goal - though - is to build the future of programming. We think building boring, internal enterprise apps represents most of programming. And if you can make building these boring things a lot faster, you have a good shot at becoming what \"comes after programming languages\".",

Optimizing existing labor resources and filling shifts efficiently is a must for every health system, but current staffing and scheduling processes are broken and antiquated. Nursing leaders are spending 50% of their time on manual scheduling tasks, while staffing decisions typically come down to a combination of phone-tag and guesswork. The average nurse gets called in last minute via texts or calls, and hospitals must resort to bonus pay just to staff to patient demand.Vitalize Care enables health systems to optimize their labor resources. Our software helps health systems proactively fill staffing gaps by automating outreach to the right nurse at the right time while optimizing for cost. We project saving our early pilot hospitals > $2M in labor costs annually, while saving their nurse managers nearly 60 hours/month by automating manual scheduling tasks. We’ve raised $3.8M from Y-Combinator, Rebel Fund, Liquid2 Ventures, and healthcare angels including the CTO of Redox, CEO of Flexpa, CEO CareRev, and executives at top health systems.",

A Kitekraft unit will generate electricity cleaner, almost invisible, and at least 50% cheaper than conventional wind turbine of the same power rating, and eventually cheaper than any other alternative. Kitekraft develops and will build, sell, and operate flying wind turbines in the 100kW to 5MW+ range, for both grid-scale energy production and off-grid applications.Our Mission: is to help solving the climate and energy crisis. Today still 84% of primary energy comes from fossil fuels. All that has to be replaced with renewables. Electrification of most sectors is in full swing, additional capacities are required for production of e-fuels and hydrogen for transportation, especially shipping and flying, but also for CO2-neutral steel production and more. We have to at least 10x the current renewable energy capacities. Wind energy will be a backbone of this because of its scalability and availability over the globe. Our flying wind turbines will accelerate adoption and provide a major portion of this since it is cheaper, feasible at more locations, simpler to deploy & maintain, and being less visible.Why Join Us?Work on exciting topics and challenges relevant to solving the energy and climate crises.Tackle unknown challenges and deliver something that has never been done before.Be at the center of an agile and dynamic team of highly motivated aerospace/wind energy/climate-tech enthusiasts.Huge learning potential and the opportunity to build things from the ground up.You’ll enjoy a high level of freedom and autonomy.Flat hierarchy and open communication.Be one of the first employees of a startup company.

As a consequence, employers spend huge amounts of time sourcing candidates manually and filtering through irrelevant CVs. Up to 80% of candidates who get invited to an interview, don't even show up.At Shopscribe we eliminate all this work for employers, by finding actively-looking candidates, vetting them and automatically matching them to the best employers using AI. We schedule interviews and extend offers to candidates faster than humans can, giving employers time back to run their businesses.To date, we’ve raised ~$1.5M from investors including Y Combinator, Entrepreneur First, world-class Venture Capital funds and industry leaders. We launched only 4 months ago and since then we've been backed by Y Combinator & Entrepreneur First, and just finished raising our seed round.

Today, companies are spending months building their own ML platforms, or relying on outdated tools that were originally designed for academics.

Historically, founders of high-quality startups are forced to choose between dilutive equity and burdensome debt, engaging with traditional capital sources (VC + venture debt) through time-consuming, distracting, offline processes. We are on a mission to change that. Arc is reinventing capital raising for growth companies, through technology.To carry out this mission, we've raised $11M in seed funding from the best seed-stage VCs in the business, including NFX (Lyft, DoorDash, Trulia) and Bain Capital Ventures (BlockFi, Cameo, Rent the Runway). We are also backed by leading Founders and operators from Stripe, Brex, and Square.We are seeking a Founding Engineer to join the Arc family. As one of the first technical hires in this exciting venture, you'll design, implement and deliver frontend and backend features, and ideate and execute its architecture. You will work directly alongside the CEO (Don Muir, Stanford GSB) and CTO (Raven Jiang, Stanford CS) to help Arc reinvent startup financing through technology. You'll solve hard problems and have a deep impact on the end-product. Expect to work in a fast-paced environment, with amazing engineers who believe in our mission. We're looking for passionate engineers who love building and learning.",

With Lago, you can make your billing fit your pricing and business workflows, not the other way around.Our StoryWe built a custom billing system from scratch for Qonto.com, a 5x Fintech unicorn in Europe.  That was not the best use of our engineers' time (it's complex to build and to maintain), but we felt 'trapped': We did not want to hack around Stripe Billing, or Chargebee, or any of the equivalents to customize it: our pricing was a mix of subscription-based and usage-based, and the existing tools were built for subscription-based businesses We did not want to leave precious % of revenue on the table. We resented their rent-seeker approach, and their closed architecture in general, with data being locked in another product. So we went for a home-made billing system, which was far from being perfect.Lago aims at fixing this problem at scale, with an open architecture by design. Our MissionLago is on a mission to pioneer a ‘Modern Pricing Stack’*, for Product Led companies.Pricing and all its components (billing, payments, invoicing, cash collection, etc.) are one of the most critical business pillars, and are yet to be systemized.Billing and pricing questions are still one of the most common sources of customer support tickets, and that’s only the tip of the iceberg.Incumbent pricing tools have been built around a “closed architecture” mindset: keeping critical data locked to claim to be the “source of truth”, closing numerous parts of their APIs, only integrating with specific partners to lock you in (e.g., Stripe Billing only working with Stripe Payments), to finally collect a rent-seeker tax on transactions (0.5-1% of revenues). We believe in a more open pricing stack, that interconnects with the company’s internal workflows and systems, with a fairer revenue model.'* inspired by the ‘Modern Data Stack’ movement (read more here: https://www.fivetran.com/blog/what-is-the-modern-data-stack)Our ValuesAmbition: we aim big, because otherwise, where is the fun?Progress: we care more about the grit, the steep learning curve, the resilience and creativity muscles, than the current status or where you come from.Humble confidence: we know our strengths and always strive for excellence, but we also know there’s so much we don’t know yetPay it forward: we’ve all started somewhere, people gave us a hand when we needed one, we don’t forget this, and reinforce this positive cycleNot taking ourselves too seriously: we are ambitious, restless learners and hustlers, but at the end of the day, our health (physical and mental), and our loved ones are what matter the most.",

We’re helping small startups and the world’s biggest companies build products, create business models, and scale their efforts globally. And we’d like your help.Our customers are the most ambitious organizations in the world. Previously, they had to create an ad hoc, informally specified, bug-ridden version of financial rails before they could do business online. We are doing the difficult-but-necessary work of building a global payments and treasury network—so entrepreneurs and enterprises can concentrate on creating value, not moving money. We operate at significant scale, but we’re still tiny relative to the opportunity. We have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.",

We want to be the financial ally of young adults, so we're also building a network of personal finance resources to help students become financially free.How does it work?Fizz connects to a user's existing bank account so that they can't spend more than they have. We extend a daily line of credit and Autopay pays off all of the user's cleared transactions at the end of each day from their connected bank account - you can think of it like a credit card that is automatically paid off every day. At the end of the month, users' payment data is reported to the credit bureaus, helping build their score. It functions just like a debit card and is completely free to use. It's that simple.Who are we?We are a determined team of 9 looking to make a difference. In a world that antagonizes students trying to secure their financial futures, we're helping build an ally.Our teamSomething that differentiates Fizz from the competition is our ability to put ourselves in the shoes of our users of all different backgrounds. We're a young but experienced team that comes from all over the place, from giants like Capital One, Microsoft, and Meta to other YC startups. See our full team at https://www.joinfizz.com/about.Our companyFizz is backed by Y-Combinator, Kleiner Perkins, SV Angel, and founders and operators from amazing companies such as Checkout.com, Postmates, Eventbrite, and more.What is it like to work at Fizz?At Fizz, we treat each other like adults. Everyone works hard differently, so we aren't nit picky about when you get your work done, so long as you get it done. We want to provide our whole team with the flexibility to succeed and grow. That attitude goes hand in hand with our unlimited vacation policy and our remote-friendly approach.As such a small team, we've come to know each other really well. Collaboration is important to all of us an is a key part of what makes our team successful. We enjoy collaborating from our office in New York, over Google Meet, or even a hybrid of the two - it's up to you.Above all, at Fizz we think big while still acting with intention. Our goals are loftey and we have tons of runaway ahead of us, so it's important to all of us that we hold ourselves to high standards. We work every day to keep moving forward towards our vision of being the financial ally for young adults.What are we looking for?We are an early-stage startup, so the first hires will be a hugely important factor in our success. Fizz will become the product of its earliest team members, and there are important attributes that we're looking for.We're looking for people who've gone deep on things they care about (like passion projects or things you've built/created). find fun in a challenge, don't wait to take action, and prize ownership on their journey to turn their work into brilliance.",

You'll be building a product that saves lives and multiple Clinical Engineers (ex-MDs and fullstack SWEs) quit lucrative medicine jobs to join Anima for that very reason! Our ambition is to be the OS for all of healthcare and life sciences, through a proprietary active learning, crowdsourcing training architecture - we call it Anima 2.0. We already have one of the biggest, highest quality labelled datasets in the world.We're profitable, growing at 300-400% MoM, and went from $0 ARR to $1m ARR in 6 months from launch (Apr '22). That's pretty unprecedented in SaaS, nevermind healthcare! We have a pretty unique hacker culture at Anima: almost everyone is technical and can code. A 'knights of the round table' structure and thinking from first principles is core to our culture, and is how we've made such rapid progress. It's reflected in how we operate: There's no separate product & engineering teams - instead, we have Clinical Engineers  who are both their own customers (MDs) and are strong fullstack engs, collaborating with pure software engineers. Due to the quality of our team, there's a heavy focus on coaching and teaching, with minimal to no line management.We're relentlessly resourceful - in 14 months, we've built an extremely loved enterprise app (NPS = 87) that users have said 'seems too good to be true'. Anima can take an information complete medical history as good or better than a typical human doctor, and automates patient comms and clinical notes.Anima is a safe haven for free thinkers and we've been careful to build a culture where everyone feels comfortable being their complete self, without ever needing to self-censor. Our hiring acceptance rate is around 0.5-0.8%, which is lower than YC. You're joining hyper elite special forces, and your crewmates will never let you down or waste your time.We hire candidates from all over the world. We have remote hubs in EU West and NA, and plans to seed some in person teams in those areas too in the next 12 months (in addition to our fully remote teams).We have a good time :) we've had team lunches in Duck&Waffle, Breakfast Club, dumplings in Chinatown, had private screenings in our own cinema, booked out the Sky Pool etc. We'll be doing at least 2x international team meets, with the next one in a beautiful chateau in Southern France.",

We build novel and hard features on a weekly basis, like MDT Hub (Slack for care teams), care orchestration (programmable no-code workflow editor). We work a lot with graphs, and shipping our ML powered features into prod involves solving difficult and novel graph problems - like how do we best cluster similar patient cases? Can we create 'dynamic DAGs' which can recursively self-improve based on clinician intervention feedback?",

We then replay these sessions on new code to automatically catch bugs before they hit production. You can watch a 60-second demo at meticulous.ai.Catching JavaScript regressions is just the start. There is an entire category of products to build on top of replay. This ranges from automatic UI previews to revealing the performance impact of frontend code.We are a London-based YC company. We are hiring an onsite (ideally a few days per week) founding engineer to join our team of four. We just raised $4m, and are backed by some of the best founders and technical leaders in Silicon Valley, including Guillermo Rauch (founder Vercel, author next.js), Jason Warner (CTO GitHub), Scott Belsky (CPO Adobe), Calvin French-Owen (founder Segment), Jared Friedman (YC partner and former CTO of Scribd) and a bunch of other incredible folks.We want to change the way the world develops software, and influence software approaches for decades to come.We are hiring our #3 founding engineer.You will have autonomy in building out this technology, but here are a few problems you might work on:Build a distributed system to concurrently replay thousands of sessions, such that a developer gets a result in seconds. Speed up the replay of sessions in a way that retains determinism. Derive algorithms to detect sessions that cover differing code paths and edge cases, and ignore sessions that are too similar. Help build out a team of world-class, highly collaborative, software engineers. As #3 engineer, you get to shape the company, and build the culture and technology from the ground up.What we look for:In a sentence: Technically brilliant, delightful to work with, combined with a self-awareness and strong desire to improve.You should have experience with TypeScript or JavaScript. However, we are more interested in raw technical brilliance than experience with any particular language or technology. You have a deep love for software engineering. Maybe you enjoy programming books like Clean Code, Designing Data Intensive Applications, Pragmatic Programmer etc. or enjoy hacking on interesting side projects. You value transparency and candid feedback, and are driven by a strong desire to become the best engineer you can be.Read more about our values here",

We believe in a world where great businesses are built on the backs of innovative products and the ability for customers to repeatedly get value out of those products. Concepts like \"time-to-value\" are increasingly important – not just for the customer, but for the business and software teams. Even initial \"onboarding\" or \"implementation\" is just the tip of the iceberg. We rally around a vision of everboarding.Our team has decades of collective experience in building onboarding and adoption workflows. We also have deep empathy with the internal Success and Growth teams who have limited resources in experimenting with and shaping these product experiences. That's why we're building Bento, to give modern software companies the system to design engaging and collaborative adoption workflows, without needing to build or maintain it in-house.",

        "about": "Our MissionShepherd's mission - improve the safety and productivity of the construction industry by advancing the use of technology on job-sites.About usShepherd is a YC and venture backed InsurTech startup for the commercial construction marketplace.The construction industry is one of the largest and most important industries in the world. It creates the physical spaces where we live, work, study, and entertain. Inherently, construction is an extremely high risk occupation. The complexity, scale, and inconsistent nature of most projects makes it difficult to predict outcomes. As a result, the role (and cost) of insurance in construction is outsized when compared to other industries.In the last decade, over $5B+ of venture capital has been invested into advancing construction technology in order to make projects safer, more efficient, and more predictable. Adoption of these tools (both hardware and software) by contractors is growing exponentially each year. But the underwriting models which evaluate and price construction insurance have failed to integrate this new available data. That’s why we are building Shepherd.Our value prop is twofold: create a fast, digital, and user-friendly experience for buying insurance in construction. At the same time, we’ll begin to break the traditional underwriting mold by leveraging data and technology to better understand, predict, and price construction risk.Our teamModernizing construction insurance requires a specific combination of skillsets, domain expertise, and backgrounds. Our founding team has both the credibility and track records to deliver world class software to support a profitable underwriting program. Justin and Mo originally met in the On Deck Fellowship program and both live in the Bay Area.Steve has known Justin for many years from within the construction risk communityJustin's coming off a prior exit in construction tech - he was co-founder / CEO of TradeTapp, which was acquired by BuildingConnected and then Autodesk.Mo led several internal engineering teams at Airbnb, including a no-code CMS that powered all of the company's marketing campaigns (2B+ per year).Steve was most recently EVP Construction Practice Leader at Chubb - one of the largest insurers in the construction industry. He brings 16+ years of underwriting experience to our team and a long track record of managing profitable programs in construction insurance.Together, we're bringing a fresh perspective to construction insurance. Technology is the answer for many of the efficiency, safety, and productivity issues that plague the construction industry. However, true gains in these areas can't be realized until stakeholders like insurance companies align with this vision. Shepherd is the bridge between construction tech and underwriting - a connection that is long overdue.

Bioresorbable SMPs have the potential to address the problems that previous materials, like the shape memory alloy, nitinol, faced, such as kinking issues. Moreover, this technology can be any time a vein-artery connection is made, such as coronary and peripheral artery bypass grafting.Between the two founders, we've been working on this for about ten years",
        "tech": "Our technology is essentially two-fold: (1) perivascular wrapping to improve vascular surgeries (hemodialysis, PABG, CABG, for example) and (2) our proprietary bioresorbable, shape memory polymer.Vascular wrapping is exactly what it sounds like - wrapping vessels. Think of it like cling wrap for veins. When bypass grafting is conducted, oftentimes (>50% for hemodialysis within one-year) the veins \"mal-adapt,\" meaning they never mature enough to become usable. Obviously this is a massive problem. This artery-mimetic wrap - has similar physical properties to an artery - basically works by (1) physically supporting the vein as it \"arterializes\" - turns into an artery-like thing and (2) induces this outward remodeling process by which cells migrate towards the site of injury - towards the wrap - and thus, cause the vein to mature. As the vein matures, the material slowly bioresorbs until it is essentially incorporated into the body and the vein has matured. Magic!Our material itself has all sorts of other interested characteristics - it's sticky, it induces neovascularization, and it is bioresorbable. And pretty much all these things are highly tunable, meaning we can make it degrade slower or faster depending on the application, we can make it more or less stretchy, more or less sticky, etc. This has all sorts of interesting applications, such as aneurysmal filler - much further down the developmental line!",

Over 3000+ companies like Ethos Life, Hipcamp, and Indiegogo use Stable to automate their mailroom and act as their permanent business address with the IRS, state, and vendors.Regulations for US entities were written in the 1800s and have changed little since. The result is a confusing system based on antiquated assumptions about the way businesses operate — requiring physical addresses, demanding wet signatures, and communicating through physical mail. These rules don't make sense for the way we work today — work takes place in the cloud and businesses are no longer tied to physical proximity or geography. We’re on a mission to fix the broken system of entity management. Starting with business addresses and mail, we’re abstracting the complex, archaic systems that make company-building painful and turning them into delightful experiences — so that modern businesses have the tools they need to move forward faster.We're backed by leading Silicon Valley investors like Y Combinator, Craft Ventures, Shakti, Hustle Fund, and founders from companies like Lattice, Apartment List, and FlexJobs.Our business is at an inflection point.

The average American now lives until 79. The people turning 65 today were 45 during the first dot-com boom. The fastest growing segment on Tik-Tok is seniors. It took 20 years, but the internet has finally arrived for seniors.But most of the products that seniors use are distinctly “pre-web” - they’re cumbersome and exploitative.When seniors buy healthcare, they have to talk to an insurance agent over the phone. These agents are exactly what you’d expect - they don’t know much about health insurance and they push Mom and Dad into the plan they get the highest commission on.When seniors look to for liquidity, reverse mortgage brokers take advantage of their financial illiteracy.When seniors look for companionship, they find themselves isolated in the suburbs they originally moved to to raise a family.We are acutely aware of these problems because we see our own parents experience them. Fair Square is fixing them. Fair Square’s goal is to build the platform that enables the best possible outcomes for American seniors post-retirement.We started by building a customer obsessed Medicare brokerage.

What makes us different from Zoom, Google Meet and alikes is our unique approach to screen sharing. We don’t record the presenter's local desktop screen but use cloud-based virtual displays. By doing that, we can automatically load the right presentation content, assist the presenter in real-time by displaying talk tracks and battle cards without the customer noticing, and have significantly more data to analyze than existing tools. Demodesk seamlessly integrates within a sales process and helps sales teams increase productivity by automating all workflows from meeting scheduling to preparation and CRM logging. We are serving 200 customers today (mostly B2B SaaS in the US and Europe) and are growing at double digit rates every month. We are a hybrid-remote team of 30 international employees with offices in Munich and SF and plan to triple in size over the next 12 months. Our vision is to become the leading online meeting platform for customer interactions. We want to enable anyone to have a great remote customer conversation. Rather than replacing human interactions, we want to augment the seller’s conversation skills by using our disruptive technology. We believe that there is an incredible opportunity to disrupt the way we, as humans, communicate. We like to use the example of self-driving cars – Today, we have cars that analyze endless amounts of data in real-time and help the driver augment his driving skills, up to the point where the car almost drives independently. When you compare this with remote conversations, the opportunity for improvement is astounding. Today, there are only functional communication tools that let us hear someone, see someone, and record a desktop screen. Imagine having this functionality combined with the vast amounts of valuable data flowing through these servers. This data is not yet being harnessed to enable people to have amazing conversations with one-another. We are about to change that. Join us on this incredibly exciting journey!",

In 2018 the company partnered with tech giant, IBM, to become the sole logging provider for IBM Cloud.Mezmo is on a mission to empower people who build solutions that shape the world. We’re doing this by delivering a platform that enables enterprises to get more value from their observability data in real time, regardless of source, destination, use case, or scale. We’re not the only ones working on this problem but we have a few things the others don’t.We’re cloud-native and know how to make the most of modern technology like Kubernetes. We have scaled a solution from zero to petabyte scale in a short amount of time, while supporting thousands of active users across multiple environments. We are hungry for change and are surrounded by enterprises telling us they’re hungry, too. We have a kick-ass group of people who are thinking about the problem analytically and are excited to change the observability world for the better. Mezmo has helped some of the world’s most innovative companies transform how they manage their systems and applications. Still, we know that we can help them get more value from their observability data by providing more flexibility and control over how they use it. This will enable teams to spend less time switching between data silos so they can focus on shipping better, more resilient, and secure products.We have momentum on our side. Last year we saw triple digit revenue growth and added 800 new customers to our roster. Recent accolades include being named to YC’s Top Companies, CRN’s 10 Hottest DevOps Startups, and EMA’s Top 3 Observability Platforms.",
