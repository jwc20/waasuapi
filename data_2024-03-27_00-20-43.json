Doesn't matter if you haven't used every technology listed above, so long as you're a fast learner and happy to jump quickly into new things.Experience level: any. So long as you can code, if we like you and you're a good fit, we'll find a role for you.Expectations: it's a startup, and we just got accepted into YCombinator 2023. So it will be busy, there's no avoiding that. But we want to create a great engineering culture that fosters innovation, learning, and mentorship. We want to teach, and we want to learn from you too.Location: we're both CA (bay area), open to remote anywhere in US, may be able to make non-US work with some kind of contracting role but priority given to US-based folk.Salary: completely dependent on experience and skill. Equity on the table. (Apologies for being vague here.
