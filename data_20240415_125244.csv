A Kitekraft unit will generate electricity cleaner, almost invisible, and at least 50% cheaper than conventional wind turbine of the same power rating, and eventually cheaper than any other alternative. Kitekraft develops and will build, sell, and operate flying wind turbines in the 100kW to 5MW+ range, for both grid-scale energy production and off-grid applications.Our Mission: is to help solving the climate and energy crisis. Today still 84% of primary energy comes from fossil fuels. All that has to be replaced with renewables. Electrification of most sectors is in full swing, additional capacities are required for production of e-fuels and hydrogen for transportation, especially shipping and flying, but also for CO2-neutral steel production and more.

The Juggernaut,New York,https://www.workatastartup.com/companies/the-juggernaut,thejuggernaut.com,Snigdha Sur,"The Juggernaut is a NY-based subscription media company and community for the South Asia-curious. Targeted subscription media is a valuable bet: Black Entertainment Television (BET) sold to Viacom for $2.3b in 2000 and Liberty Media valued Univision at $14b in 2017. The U.S. South Asia diaspora alone has $460b of spending power and is the fastest growing demographic in the U.S., yet is underserved. We're backed by some incredible investors, including Precursor Ventures (also in The Athletic, Superhuman), Kevin Lin (co-founder, Twitch), Adam Hansmann (co-founder, The Athletic), and Balaji Srinivasan (ex-Coinbase CTO, ex-GP a16z).","We are looking for our first full-stack engineer to help take us to the next level, from a newsletter to a South Asia-focused media giant, using the power of software and data.  Depending on experience and milestones, the role could transition into that of CTO or Head of Product and Technology. Building a media company is difficult. Building a media company powered by subscription and having your customers open up their wallets means building an excellent user experience and getting the stories right. We are looking for someone who can test and iterate quickly. We are looking for someone who can define our initial tech stack and architecture for a paywall-powered media platform (and, eventually, an app). You will build the tools to improve user engagement across platforms (newsletter, social media, site, etc.) to help build and grow a thriving online and offline community. You will help build the tools that allow us to quickly understand which stories are worth covering or curating, as well as identifying potential contributors. You will help build the elements of a successful, innovative referral program.The interesting problems to solve include: what subscription offer can lead to the highest conversion, what paywall best balances user engagement with revenue (absolute paywall, a few free articles, locked articles), which platforms (newsletter, site, social) will drive the highest engagement.",Senior Full-Stack Engineer (Full-time) - potential to transition to CTO,https://www.workatastartup.com/jobs/15526,"New York, NY fulltime  Visa Required Any (new grads ok)"
